Some neat little bug-fixes, just in time for Christmas:

- server: Add missing entitlements for iOS 16, required to remap binary files in
  memory. Thanks [@as0ler][]!
- android: Fix Java hooking of interpreter-run methods on Android 14.
- Fix argv[0] shown in CLI tools such as frida-server and frida-inject. Thanks
  [@bet4it][]!
