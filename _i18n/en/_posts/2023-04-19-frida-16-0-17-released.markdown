Time for a bug-fix release with only one change: turns out the ARMv8 BTI interop
[introduced][] in 16.0.14 is problematic on Apple A12+ SoCs when running in
arm64e mode, i.e. with pointer authentication enabled.

Kudos to [@miticollo][] for reporting and helping triage the cause, and
[@mrmacete][] for digging further into it, brainstorming potential fixes, and
implementing the [fix][]. You guys rock! ❤️
