Turns out the major surgery that Gum went through in 15.1.15 introduced some
error-handling regressions. Errors thrown vs. actually expected by the Vala code
in frida-core did not match, which resulted in the process crashing instead of a
friendly error bubbling up to e.g. the Python bindings. That is now finally
taken care of. I wish we had noticed it sooner, though â€” we're clearly lacking
test coverage in this area.

Beside the error-handling fixes, we're also including a build system [fix][] for
incremental build issues. Kudos to [Londek][] for this nice contribution.

Enjoy!
