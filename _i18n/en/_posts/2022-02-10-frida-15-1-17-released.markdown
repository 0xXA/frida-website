One notable improvement in this release is that `Java.backtrace()` got a major
overhaul. It is now lazy and >10x faster. I have also refined its [API][],
which is now considered stable.

While working on [frida-java-bridge][], I optimized how Env objects are handled,
so we can recycle an existing instance if we already have one for the current
thread.

The remaining goodies are covered by the changelog below, so definitely check
it out.

Enjoy!
