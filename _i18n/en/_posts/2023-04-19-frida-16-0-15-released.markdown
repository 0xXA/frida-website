Here's a release fixing two stability issues affecting users on Apple platforms:

- interceptor: Keep thread ports alive between suspend and resume on Darwin. We
  were borrowing the Mach thread port right names released by
  enumerate_threads(), assuming that another reference existed to keep each of
  them alive. When this wasn't the case we would at best pass an invalid Mach
  port right name to thread_resume(), and worst-case we would use a totally
  unrelated port. Regardless, we would leave such threads suspended forever.
  Thanks [@mrmacete][]!
- agent: Dispose ThreadSuspendMonitor in its own transaction. Since Interceptor
  relies on ThreadSuspendMonitor passthrough, disposing of it in its own
  transaction and after all the other components which use Interceptor at
  destruction time makes sure no Frida thread will attempt executing code on
  non-executable pages at teardown time. Thanks [@mrmacete][]!
