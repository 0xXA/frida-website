It appears I should have had some more coffee this morning, so here's another
release to actually fix [this][] broken fix back in 15.1.25:

> - java: (android) Prevent ART from compiling replaced methods

Turns out the *kAccCompileDontBother* constant changed in Android 8.1. It also
didn't exist before 7.0. Oops! This release [fixes][] it, for real this time ðŸ˜Š
