This time we're bringing you two bugfixes and one new feature, just in time for
the weekend.

Gum used to depend on GIO, but that dependency was removed in the previous
release. The unfortunate result of that change was that agent and gadget no
longer tore down GIO, as they were relying on Gum's teardown code doing that.
What this meant was that we were leaving threads behind, and that is never a
good thing. So that's the first bugfix.

Also in the previous release, over in our Python bindings, setup.py went through
some heavy changes. We improved the .egg download logic, but managed to break
the local .egg logic. That's the second bugfix.

Onto the new feature. For those of you using Gum's JavaScript bindings, GumJS,
we now support `console.count()` and `console.countReset()`. These are
implemented by browsers and Node.js, and make it easy to count the number of
times a given label has been seen. Kudos to [@yotamN][] for this nice
contribution.

Enjoy!
