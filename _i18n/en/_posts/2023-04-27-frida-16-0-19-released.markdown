Some exciting stability improvements this time around:

- darwin: Make spawn() aware of the [prewarm][] feature used on iOS >= 15. What
  happens is that the most frequently used apps are being spawned ahead of time
  by *dasd* and kept suspended until the user attempts to launch them, in order
  to save some startup time. This was in the way of Frida's spawn mechanism
  because:
  - apps launched this way won't be going through launchd when expected, causing
    a “timeout was reached” error, or more complex race conditions
  - Frida needs to spawn a fresh process to ensure early instrumentation

  We solve these problems by:
  - ignoring prewarm spawns from the launchd agent (though they're still emitted
    as spawn if spawn gating is enabled)
  - killing existing prewarmed apps before attempting to spawn them
  Thanks [@mrmacete][]!
- glib: Ensure {Input,Output}Stream only g_poll() if pollable. This is essential on
  Apple OSes and BSDs, where GLib uses kqueue to implement GMainContext, as it
  may otherwise end up waiting forever when the file-descriptor represents an
  ordinary file. Thanks [@hsorbo][]!
- android: Fix x86 devkits by improving libffi to avoid problematic relocations.
- gadget: Fix deadlock during Windows process termination. Kudos to
  [@Palacee-hun][] for reporting!
