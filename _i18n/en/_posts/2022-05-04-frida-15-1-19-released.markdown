Turns out 15.1.18 had a release automation bug that resulted in stale Python
binding artifacts getting uploaded.

To make this release a little happier, I also threw in a Stalker improvement
for x86/64, where the *clone3* syscall is now [handled][] as well. This was
caught by Stalker's test-suite on some systems.

Enjoy!
