This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Frida. We’ll cover topics such
as doing interactive function tracing from the command-line, building your own
tools on top of Frida's APIs, and give you some advice on participating in the
future development of Frida itself.

## So what is Frida, exactly?

Frida is a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit. It lets you inject snippets of
JavaScript into native apps on Windows, Mac, Linux and iOS. Frida also provides
you with some simple tools built on top of the Frida API. These can be used
as-is, tweaked to your needs, or serve as examples of how to use the API.

## ProTips™, Notes, and Warnings
