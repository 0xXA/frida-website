- Write more and even better documentation
- Make those awesome YouTube tutorial videos we've heard so much about in the news
- Build some cool applications with Frida
- Help out with some new, fancy schmanzy web pages that make us all look awesome
- Contribute new features back into the Frida libraries

In any case please do join our very inclusive channel on the amazing Internet
