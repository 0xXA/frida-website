      <h2>Scriptable</h2>
      <p>
        Inject your own scripts into black box processes. Edit a script, hit
        save in your text editor, and instantly see the results. No compilation,
        deployment, or program restart needed. Hook any function, spy on crypto
        APIs or trace private application code, no source code needed either!
        Frida can also do stealthy code tracing without relying on software or
        hardware breakpoints. Think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</a>
        in user-space, based on dynamic recompilation, like <a href="http://www.dynamorio.org/">DynamoRIO</a>
        and <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool">PIN</a>,
        but fully scriptable.

      <h2>Portable</h2>
      <p>
        Built with portability in mind from day one, Frida works on a lot of
        different OSes and architectures. Currently this means Windows, macOS,
        GNU/Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX, spanning architectures from Intel to
        ARM, ARM64, and MIPS. QNX and MIPS are the most recent additions, thanks
        to a member of our awesome community.
        We also have a wide range of language bindings. Install the Node.js
        bindings from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/frida">npm</a>,
        grab a Python package from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/frida">PyPI</a>,
        or use Frida through our
        <a href="https://github.com/frida/frida-swift">Swift bindings</a>,
        <a href="http://build.frida.re/frida/windows/x64-Release/bin/Frida.dll">.NET bindings</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/frida/frida/releases">Qt/Qml bindings</a>, or
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/oleavr/e6af8791adbef8fbde06">C API</a>.

      <h2>Free</h2>
      <p>
        Frida is and will always be <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free software</a>.
        We want to empower the next generation of developer tools, and
        help people achieve interoperability through reverse engineering.
        Also, recognizing that a lot of companies roll their own dynamic
        instrumentation, we think it would be awesome if we could all
        collaborate on building the best possible toolkit to faciliate this.
        Hence, our licensing allows using Frida in non-free software. We are
        proud that <a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/">NowSecure</a> is using
        Frida to do fast, deep analysis of mobile apps
        <a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/mobile-app-vetting/">at scale</a>.
