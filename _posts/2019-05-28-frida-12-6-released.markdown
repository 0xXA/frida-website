After a flurry of fixes across all platforms over the last few weeks,
I figured it was time to do another minor bump to call attention to
this release.

One particular fix is worth mentioning specifically. There was a long-
standing bug in our Android Java integration, where exception delivery
would intermittently result in the process crashing with
*GetOatQuickMethodHeader()* typically in the stack-trace. Shout-out to
[Jake Van Dyke][] and [Giovanni Rocca][] for helping track this one
down. This bug has been around for as long as ART has been supported,
so this fix is worth celebrating. ðŸŽ‰

Our V8 runtime is also a lot more stable, child-gating works better
than ever before, Android device compatibility is much improved, etc.

So bottom line is that this is the most stable version of Frida ever
released â€“ and now is the time to make sure you're running Frida 12.6.

Enjoy!

### Changes in 12.6.1

- The exception delivery fix in the Android Java integration introduced
  a performance bottleneck when running the VM in interpreter mode, e.g.
  through *Java.deoptimizeEverything()*. For example when running the
  Dropbox app from start to login screen, this would take ~94 seconds
  on a Pixel 3 running Android 9, and now takes ~6 seconds.

### Changes in 12.6.2

- Android Java integration now supports more arm64 systems thanks to a
  fix contributed by [Giovanni Rocca][].
- Android Java integration once again supports being used by more than
  one script at a time.
