After a flurry of fixes across all platforms over the last few weeks,
I figured it was time to do another minor bump to call attention to
this release.

One particular fix is worth mentioning specifically. There was a long-
standing bug in our Android Java integration, where exception delivery
would intermittently result in the process crashing with
*GetOatQuickMethodHeader()* typically in the stack-trace. Shout-out to
[Jake Van Dyke][] and [Giovanni Rocca][] for helping track this one
down. This bug has been around for as long as ART has been supported,
so this fix is worth celebrating. ðŸŽ‰

Our V8 runtime is also a lot more stable, child-gating works better
than ever before, Android device compatibility is much improved, etc.

So bottom line is that this is the most stable version of Frida ever
released â€“ and now is the time to make sure you're running Frida 12.6.

Enjoy!
